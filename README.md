Repository for Lend.me 
======

This repository currently contains the Software Requirements Specificiation for the application, Lend.me, written by the software development team, "Not Our (Seg)Fault!", for Software Engineering I and II, CEN4020-1, at Florida State University. Lend.me, (a fictional name), will be developed during the Spring 2014 semester.  The SRS was developed over the course of FAll 2013.  Lend.me will be a personal loan-tracking application and will serve three main purposes:

First, it will facilitate the creation and recording of a loan contract. This is important for remembering when the loan is due and for legal purposes (in the event that the lender wishes to take the borrower to court). Second, it will be a reminding service. It reminds all parties of their obligation and their due. Third, it will be a repayment service. It facilitates the paying of the initial loan and its subsequent repayment.

Lend.me will be written in JavaScript using Node.js.  We will use the noSQL database, MongoDB, to store user and loan information.
